            <h1>What is Bob?</h1>
            <p>
                Bob is a Replay Editor for the ReplayMod, a Minecraft mod to create videos such as timelapses or cinematics.
                <br>
                As Bob features it's own specialized and custom scripting language, only the sky is the limit.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, Bob is only available as a Lite version, as the custom scripting language hasn't been implemented yet.
                <br>
                This Lite version works on all Minecraft versions supported by the ReplayMod and can:

                <ul>
                    <li>Change the weather</li>
                    <li>Change the time</li>
                    <li>Remove the chat messages</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h1>History:</h1>
            <p>
                Bob started out as an experiment. I wanted to see if it was possible to change a username in a Replay.
                <br>
                It turned out to be possible, but I wanted to do more.
                <br>
                Replays are just a dump of the entire communication between the server and the client.
                <br>
                The ReplayMod then emulated a Minecraft server to replay the communication, so we can see what happened.
            </p>

            <h1>How it works:</h1>
            <p>
                 As I previously said, Replays are just a dump of the client-server communication.
                 <br>
                 What Bob edits is those network packets directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's use a real example so you know how it works, so let's change the time on a 1.18.2 Replay.
                <br>
                To understand how to change the time, we have to understand how the time is sent to the client.
                <br>
                As it turns out, the server is sending a <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Time_Update">Time Packet</a>. Here is its format:

                <pre style="line-height: normal;">
        +-----------------------------------------+
        |       Packet ID: 0x59 (89 decimal)      |
        +-------------+------+--------------------+
        |     Name    | Type |     Description    |
        +-------------+------+--------------------+
        | World Age   | Long | World age in ticks |
        +-------------+------+--------------------+
        | Time of Day | Long | The time in ticks  |
        +-------------+------+--------------------+
                </pre>

                The time of day is exactly what we want to edit, and we know how much bytes it takes (a long is stored on 8 bytes, and it's also defined in the <a href="https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Data_types">Data Types</a> section of wiki.vg)
                <br>
                Those Time Update packets are sent every 20 ticks.
                <br><br>

                Let's look at it's data in a hex editor:
                <br>
                <img src="../assets/images/bob/time_update_packet_nothing.png">
                <br><br>
                With ImHex, I can highlight certain block of data to make reading hexadecimal data easier:
                <br>
                <img src="../assets/images/bob/time_update_packet_data_highlight.png">
                <br><br>
                Let's see what those values mean.<br>
                When highlighting the first 8 bytes (the world age) and telling ImHex to treat the data as big endian, we get this:
                <br>
                <img src="../assets/images/bob/time_update_packet_selecting_world_time.png">
                <br><br>
                A long is 64 bits, so the value we get from uint64_t is 112800 (uint64_t stands for "unsigned 64 bit integer type"). 112800 ticks corresponds to 94 mins.
                <br>
                Now let's check the second set of 8 bytes (the time of day in ticks), we get this:
                <br>
                <img src="../assets/images/bob/time_update_packet_selecting_time_of_day.png">
                <br><br>
                This value has to be treated as a signed number, so we have to look at int64_t. Its value is -18000 ticks.<br>
                As we can see, this value is negative. This means the sky won't automatically move for 20 ticks.<br>
                This is used when the doDaylightCycle gamerule is set to false.<br>
                <br>
                Now, if you tell Bob to edit the time in a Replay, the steps it'll follow are as followed:
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the correct packet</li>
                    <li>Ignore the first 8 bytes</li>
                    <li>Write the new time value, while discarding the old one</li>
                </ul>

                Instead of hardcoding those steps, I created a structure language, to tell Bob how to read and write packets.<br>
                This is the structure of the time update packet:<br>
                <pre>
        packet "time_update" {
            long "world_age";
            long "time_of_day";
        }
                </pre>

                This Packet Structure Language file (neatly called PSL) is fed into a <a href="https://github.com/RaderRMT/Bob/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/rader/psl/lexer/Lexer.java">Lexer</a> that will generate a list of <a href="https://github.com/RaderRMT/Bob/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/rader/psl/tokens/Token.java">Token</a> while doing some error checking.
                <br>
                <br>

                After that, the list of token is fed into a <a href="https://github.com/RaderRMT/Bob/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/rader/psl/lexer/Validator.java">Validator</a> that will do further error checking such as type checking and variable scope analysis.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the validator found no issues, the list of tokens is then fed into a <a href="https://github.com/RaderRMT/Bob/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/rader/psl/packets/definition/PacketDefinitionFactory.java">PacketDefinitionFactory</a> that will convert the list of tokens into a parse tree (a <a href="https://github.com/RaderRMT/Bob/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/rader/psl/packets/definition/PacketDefinition.java">PacketDefinition</a> in my code). The Validator and the PacketDefinitionFactory form what's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser">Parser</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                This definition is an intermediary between the PSL file and the values Bob will edit. The definition will be used in the <a href="https://github.com/RaderRMT/Bob/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/rader/psl/packets/serialization/PacketDeserializer.java">PacketDeserializer</a> to turn the bytes to a format Bob can understand and edit, and in the <a href="https://github.com/RaderRMT/Bob/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/rader/psl/packets/serialization/PacketSerializer.java">PacketSerializer</a> to write the bytes from the format Bob can understand.

                <br><br>
                With this, if you tell Bob to edit the "time_of_day" value of a "time_update" packet, it'll know what to edit, and how.
                <br>
                With this technique, it's also very easy to update Bob to a new Minecraft protocol when a new version releases. Everything is hand-made and no libraries are used.
